# recommender-system-resit-
I could not put datasets in github because it says they are to big, I assume that you will just check the code and not run it but if you run them, then you have to add Dataset Preprocessing folder to make it work. 
To access my resit, you have to go on merged,then lab 1, and then it's the file ResitRS.ipynb and my alternative approach is pipelineAlternativeResit.ipynb.
