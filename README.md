# recommender-system-resit-
To access my resit, you have to go on merged,then lab 1, and then it's the file ResitRS.ipynb and my alternative approach is pipeline Alternative Resit.ipynb.
(by the way, I could not cloned your project for lab 1 so maybe there are stuff missing but my two resits files are here with my answers in it and the code which runs correctly, so I assume you will just check the code and my results and you will not run it but if you do and it doesn't work, please take into account that it should work, I just had troubles cloning your file.)
