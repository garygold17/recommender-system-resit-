# recommender-system-resit-
To access my resit, you have to go on merged,then lab 1, and then it's the file ResitRS.ipynb and my alternative approach is pipeline Alternative Resit.ipynb.
(by the way, I could not cloned your project for lab 1 so maybe there are stuff missing but my two resits files are here with my answers in it and the code which runs correctly, so I assume you will just check the code and my results and you will not run it but if you do and it doesn't work, please take into account that it should work, I just had troubles cloning your file, but for me it works correctly as you can see in my files, there is no error when I runned it but you might have troubles if you do. I'm sorry for that but I normally not use github and I don't really know how it works, I can send you my stuff via mail if you want so that you can maybe do it by yourself but anyway, normally it should work, and anyway my answers are there and computed on github so it should be good, thank you for your comprehension.)
